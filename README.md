For the 2nd capstone I am creating an app to teach the basics of Ving Tsun Kung Fu 
The app will pull instructional videos from my youtube channel using youtube's API
users will be able to watch those videos and then post videos (you tube links) of themselves performing the same skill featured in the videos, admin and user will be able to make comments on the videos that they post.

https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

schema is as follows

User/Admin -> Videos -> Comments

I have created the json schemas for...
1. User
2. userVideo
3. videoComment

Relationships are, a user has videos, a video has comments.
